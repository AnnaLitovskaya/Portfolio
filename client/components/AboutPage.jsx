        My background is in mechanical engineering and industrial design. I have
        been a CNC machine programmer for 7 years before making the radical
        change of careers to web developement. I am most excited when I come
        across a difficult problem that needs a new and innovative solution.
        When I am not persuing my career goals or printing a widget on my 3D
        printer, you can catch me hiking in the mountains or attempting to climb
        a large rock.
